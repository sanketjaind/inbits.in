1. Make a folder so that you can keep the required files together.
2. Choose a cool icon for your extension and save it in your folder.(make sure the icon is small and has .png format)
3. Open any editor of your choice.
4. The first file that you would require is a mainfest.json, which will have the URL on which you want the extension to work, the name of the extension, its description, and name of the icon file.
A manifest.json file looks something like this:

{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "Ultimatix", 
  "description": "Fills ultimatix login page",
  "version": "1.0",
  "browser_action": {
   "default_icon": "icon.png"
  },
  "content_scripts": [ {
  "matches": ["https://auth.ultimatix.net/*"],
  "js": ["popup.js"]
  } ],
  "permissions": [
   "activeTab"
   ]
}
5. The second file required would have the functionalities that you want your extension to perform. 
In our case we want it to fill a login form, our popup.js file(any name would work but make sure it has the same name in manifest.json)
      var myUsername = 'type_your_username_here';
      var myPassword = 'type_your_password_here';
//finds the fields in ultimatix
      var loginField = document.getElementById('USER');
      var passwordField = document.getElementById('PASSWORD');
//fills in your username and password
      loginField.value = myUsername;
      passwordField.value = myPassword;
6. Now, your folder contains icon.png, manifest.json, popup.js and you are ready to deploy.
7. Open Google Chrome, go to the Customize and Control Google Chrome > More tools > Extensions
